A compilation of all my components for my Roblox projects

Client components should only be used on the client
Server components should only be used on the server
Shared can be used on both the server and the client and may have functions unique for each.

Scripts that have children are folders with the "__" intital syntax with the rest being the same name as the parent.
Example: ZoneClass script would be a folder called '__ZoneClass' with a .luau file named 'ZoneClass' inside
